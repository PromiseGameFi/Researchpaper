# X402

## What is X402?

**In Simple Terms:** X402 is like a "pay-per-use" vending machine for the internet. Instead of subscribing to services or creating accounts, you pay small amounts (micropayments) instantly to access what you need - like paying for a single API call, reading one article, or getting one piece of data.

**Technical Definition:** X402 is an open-source, chain-agnostic payment protocol built on top of HTTP that activates the long-dormant HTTP status code **402 "Payment Required"** to enable instant, frictionless payments for web resources using blockchain technology (primarily stablecoins like USDC).

### Visual Overview

## Why X402 Matters

### The Problem X402 Solves

#### Traditional Payment Systems Are Broken for the Internet:

1. **High Fees**&#x20;
   * Credit cards charge 2-3% + $0.30 per transaction
   * Makes small payments ($0.01 - $1.00) impossible
2. **Slow Settlement**&#x20;
   * Payments take 2-3 business days to settle
   * Merchants wait to receive money
3. **Account Friction**&#x20;
   * Every service requires creating an account
   * Sharing personal information repeatedly
   * Managing passwords and API keys
4. **Not Built for Machines**&#x20;
   * AI agents can't autonomously pay for services
   * No programmatic payment flow

### The X402 Solution

## How X402 Works

### The Payment Flow (Simple Version)

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Initial request / Access attempt

You knock on a door (request a resource).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Server demands payment

The door says "That'll be $0.10" (Server responds with 402 Payment Required).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Client pays

You slide money under the door (Client sends payment authorization).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Server verifies and serves

The door verifies the money and opens (Server verifies payment and delivers content).
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### The Technical Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Client/AI Agent
    participant Server as Web Server
    participant Facilitator as Payment Facilitator (Optional)
    participant Blockchain as Blockchain Network

    Client->>Server: GET /api/data
    Note over Server: No payment detected
    Server->>Client: HTTP 402 Payment Required
    Note over Server: Returns payment details:<br/>Amount, Wallet Address,<br/>Network, Asset

    Client->>Client: Sign payment authorization
    Note over Client: Creates EIP-712 signature<br/>with payment details

    Client->>Server: GET /api/data<br/>Header: X-PAYMENT
    Server->>Facilitator: Verify payment signature
    Facilitator->>Blockchain: Submit transaction
    Blockchain->>Facilitator: Transaction confirmed
    Facilitator->>Server: Payment verified ✓
    Server->>Client: HTTP 200 OK<br/>+ Requested Resource<br/>+ X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE
    
    Note over Client,Server: Total time: ~2 seconds
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Initial Request (No Payment)

Example request:

```http
GET /api/premium-data HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

Server receives a request with no payment present.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Server Responds with Payment Requirement

Server responds with HTTP 402 and payment details. Example:

```http
HTTP/1.1 402 Payment Required
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "maxAmountRequired": "0.10",
  "resource": "/api/premium-data",
  "description": "Access requires payment",
  "payTo": "0xABCD...1234",
  "asset": "0xA0b8...EB48",
  "network": "base-mainnet",
  "facilitator": "https://x402.org/facilitator"
}
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Client Sends Payment Authorization

Client signs a payment authorization and includes it in the request header. Example:

```http
GET /api/premium-data HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
X-PAYMENT: {
  "scheme": "exact",
  "version": "1.0",
  "data": {
    "signature": "0x1234...",
    "validAfter": "1234567890",
    "validBefore": "1234567899",
    ...
  }
}
```

The signature typically uses EIP-712 structured data signing.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Server Returns Resource with Payment Confirmation

After verification, server responds with 200 OK and payment confirmation metadata:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE: {
  "transactionHash": "0xabc...def",
  "blockNumber": "12345678",
  "status": "confirmed"
}

{
  "data": "Your premium content here..."
}
```
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Payment Schemes

X402 supports different payment models through extensible "schemes":

#### Exact Scheme (Currently Available)

* Pay a specific, fixed amount (e.g., "$0.10 to read this article")
* Use case: One-time access, fixed-price APIs

#### Up To Scheme (Proposed)

* Pay up to a maximum amount based on usage (e.g., "Up to $1.00 for API computation time")
* Use case: Variable compute, token generation, streaming data

#### Deferred Scheme (Recently Proposed by Cloudflare)

* Aggregate multiple small payments into one transaction and settle later (hourly, daily, etc.)
* Use case: High-frequency micro-transactions, web crawling

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Exact Scheme
        E1[Fixed Price<br/>$0.10]
        E2[Pay Once<br/>Get Access]
    end
    
    subgraph Up To Scheme
        U1[Max Price<br/>Up to $1.00]
        U2[Pay for<br/>Actual Usage]
    end
    
    subgraph Deferred Scheme
        D1[Batch Payments<br/>100 requests]
        D2[Single Settlement<br/>Once per day]
    end
    
    E1 --> E2
    U1 --> U2
    D1 --> D2
    
    style E1 fill:#50C878
    style U1 fill:#4A90E2
    style D1 fill:#FFA500
```

### Security Model

X402 uses industry-standard cryptographic methods:

1. **EIP-712 Signatures** - Structured data signing for clear wallet interfaces
2. **ERC-3009 Gasless Transfers** - Users don't need ETH for gas fees
3. **Trust-Minimizing** - No intermediary can move funds without authorization
4. **Open Source** - Community-audited code for transparency

***

## Use Cases

### 1. AI Agent Payments&#x20;

Scenario: An AI research assistant needs to gather data from multiple premium sources.

With X402:

* AI agent autonomously discovers services with X402
* Pays $0.10 per API call as needed
* No accounts, no API keys, no human intervention
* Example total for occasional usage: $5-20/month

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant AI Agent
    participant Service1 as Data Service 1<br/>(x402 enabled)
    participant Service2 as API Service 2<br/>(x402 enabled)
    participant Service3 as Tool Service 3<br/>(x402 enabled)

    User->>AI Agent: "Research climate change trends"
    
    AI Agent->>Service1: Request climate data
    Service1->>AI Agent: 402 Payment Required ($0.10)
    AI Agent->>Service1: Auto-pay $0.10
    Service1->>AI Agent: Climate dataset
    
    AI Agent->>Service2: Request analysis API
    Service2->>AI Agent: 402 Payment Required ($0.25)
    AI Agent->>Service2: Auto-pay $0.25
    Service2->>AI Agent: Analysis results
    
    AI Agent->>Service3: Request visualization tool
    Service3->>AI Agent: 402 Payment Required ($0.05)
    AI Agent->>Service3: Auto-pay $0.05
    Service3->>AI Agent: Generated charts
    
    AI Agent->>User: Complete research report
    Note over User,AI Agent: Total cost: $0.40<br/>Zero human intervention
```

### 2. Content Monetization&#x20;

For publishers:

* Charge per article ($0.05-0.50) instead of monthly subscriptions
* No paywall account creation friction
* Instant revenue

For readers:

* Only pay for what you read
* No subscriptions to manage
* Anonymous access

### 3. API Monetization&#x20;

Old model:

* Free tier abused; paid tiers are monthly subscriptions

X402 model:

* Pay per request ($0.001-0.10 per call)
* No free tier abuse
* Fair pricing for all users

### 4. Web Crawling & Data Access&#x20;

Problem: Bots and scrapers consume resources without compensation.

Solution:

* Charge crawlers per page ($0.01)
* Legitimate bots pay automatically; bad actors discouraged
* Website owners monetize content

### 5. Compute & Storage Services&#x20;

Pay-per-use model for:

* GPU compute time
* Storage access
* Database queries
* Image processing
* AI model inference

## Implementation Guide

### For Developers: Adding X402 to Your Service

#### Basic Implementation (Express.js)

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Install the middleware

```bash
npm install x402-express dotenv
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Add to your server (Just 1 line!)

Example Express.js integration:

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import { paymentMiddleware } from 'x402-express';

const app = express();

// Single line to enable X402 payments!
app.use(
  paymentMiddleware(
    "0xYourWalletAddress",
    {
      "GET /api/premium-data": { price: "$0.10", network: "base-mainnet" },
      "POST /api/ai-service": { price: "$0.50", network: "base-mainnet" }
    },
    { url: "https://x402.org/facilitator" }
  )
);

// Your regular endpoints
app.get('/api/premium-data', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ data: "Premium content here!" });
});

app.listen(3000);
```

That's it — your API now requires payment.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### For Non-Developers: What You Need to Know

## FAQs

<details>

<summary>Do I need cryptocurrency to use X402?</summary>

A: As a user, yes - you need a small amount of stablecoin (like USDC) to pay. As a merchant, you receive stablecoins which you can convert to regular currency.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is this only for crypto people?</summary>

A: No! The goal is to make it invisible. Users just see "Pay $0.10" and click - the crypto happens in the background.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What about credit cards?</summary>

A: Future versions of X402 may support traditional payment rails, but currently it's crypto-based for speed and low fees.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can my AI assistant use this?</summary>

A: Yes! That's a primary use case. AI agents can autonomously pay for services using X402.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How much does it cost?</summary>
