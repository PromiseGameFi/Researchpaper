- [Promise Emmanuel Oluwadare](https://promiseresearch.web3ium.space/README): "My career started off as a gameplay engineer, and I have worked at top studios like Naughty Dog and also led the development team at EOTH Game Studio."

- [The Science of Neural Image Synthesis](https://promiseresearch.web3ium.space/the-science-of-neural-image-synthesis): "The process of 3D rendering has historically been defined by the \"Render Bottleneck.\" In software like Blender, a high-quality frame requires the hardware to calculate thousands of light rays as they interact with materials and geometry. This linear calculation process is slow and limits the iteration speed of 3D modellers."
- [Running Practical Worlds Onchain](https://promiseresearch.web3ium.space/running-practical-worlds-onchain): "A single monolithic L1 that naively tries to process every transaction on every full validator will always hit a hard ceiling. Practical ultra-high-TPS architectures therefore combine horizontal parallelism (sharding / many sequencers), fast deterministic local execution (compiled & parallel VMs), sublinear consensus and signature primitives (BLS, aggregation), and data availability systems with erasure coding and sampling. Our goal is to present - (a) a reproducible numerical model; (b) a practical architecture that composes known building blocks; and (c) strategies for adding decen­tralized AI acceleration."
- [Scaling Blockchain Throughput: Overcoming the Synchronization Bottleneck in High-TPS Systems](https://promiseresearch.web3ium.space/scaling-blockchain-throughput-overcoming-the-synchronization-bottleneck-in-high-tps-systems): "*."
- [Oracles for Trustworthy AI + Data Privacy with Blockchain: A Practical Architecture](https://promiseresearch.web3ium.space/oracles-for-trustworthy-ai-+-data-privacy-with-blockchain-a-practical-architecture): "1. Unverifiable inputs → Models depend on web, API, or device signals that the chain/app cannot _cryptographically_ verify (prices, events, weather, anti-cheat signals, etc.). This creates a classic “oracle problem.”."
- [What Makes a Blockchain Truly Fast: A Technical Deep Dive](https://promiseresearch.web3ium.space/what-makes-a-blockchain-truly-fast-a-technical-deep-dive): "Keywords - Blockchain Performance, Consensus Mechanisms, Throughput Optimization, Network Scalability, Cryptographic Efficiency."
- [x402\_gitbook\_guide](https://promiseresearch.web3ium.space/x402_gitbook_guide): "In Simple Terms - X402 is like a \"pay-per-use\" vending machine for the internet. Instead of subscribing to services or creating accounts, you pay small amounts (micropayments) instantly to access what you need — like paying for a single API call, reading one article, or getting one piece of data."

- [Privacy as Infrastructure: Trustless AI Systems](https://promiseresearch.web3ium.space/privacy-as-infrastructure-trustless-ai-systems): "Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown quickly and created a privacy gap. We need to balance using these tools with keeping control of our data. This report looks at new technologies that address this issue. We call this \\\"Privacy as Infrastructure.\\\" This means we use software and hardware to protect data automatically."
