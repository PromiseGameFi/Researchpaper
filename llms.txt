- [Promise Emmanuel Oluwadare](https://promiseresearch.web3ium.space/README): My career started off as a gameplay engineer, and I have worked at top studios like Naughty Dog and also led the development team at EOTH Game Studio.
- [The Physics and Science of  Interactive World Models](https://promiseresearch.web3ium.space/the-physics-and-science-of-interactive-world-models): This research analyzes the mathematical principles of generative interactive environments, specifically Genie 3 and Hunyuan. Unlike traditional computer graphics that use explicit physics formulas, these models learn physical laws by observing video data. We describe the core components of these systems: spatio-temporal tokenization, latent action models, and autoregressive dynamics. The research explains how scaling these models leads to emergent physical properties like gravity and collision handling. We conclude that these systems represent a shift from logical simulation to statistical prediction of physical reality.
- [The Science of Neural Image Synthesis](https://promiseresearch.web3ium.space/the-science-of-neural-image-synthesis): Traditional 3D rendering relies on path-tracing algorithms that calculate light interactions through millions of samples, leading to significant time delays in production. This paper explores the transition to Neural Image Synthesis as a solution to this bottleneck. By analyzing systems such as Google DeepMind’s Genie 3 and Tencent’s Hunyuan, we demonstrate how AI can learn physical and visual laws directly from data. We investigate Neural Denoising, NeRFs, Gaussian Splatting, and World Models as a framework to move from logical simulation to statistical inference, reducing render times from hours to milliseconds.
- [Running Practical Worlds Onchain](https://promiseresearch.web3ium.space/running-practical-worlds-onchain): A technical research paper on how blockchains can scale toward hundreds-of-millions of TPS, a numerical throughput model, and practical approaches for adding AI acceleration while preserving decentralization
- [Scaling Blockchain Throughput: Overcoming the Synchronization Bottleneck in High-TPS Systems](https://promiseresearch.web3ium.space/scaling-blockchain-throughput-overcoming-the-synchronization-bottleneck-in-high-tps-systems): Blockchain systems aim to maximize throughput while preserving decentralization and security. However, achieving transactions-per-second (TPS) at scale remains one of the most difficult engineering challenges. This paper explores the primary technical bottlenecks preventing blockchains from reaching millions of TPS, focusing on network propagation, consensus efficiency, state execution, data availability, and the trade-offs between scalability, security, and decentralization. We present a structured analysis of each bottleneck, drawing from existing research in distributed systems, peer-to-peer networking, and cryptographic consensus.
- [Oracles for Trustworthy AI + Data Privacy with Blockchain: A Practical Architecture](https://promiseresearch.web3ium.space/oracles-for-trustworthy-ai-+-data-privacy-with-blockchain-a-practical-architecture): Modern AI systems increasingly drive game logic, rewards, markets, and user experiences. But three chronic issues limit safe deployment:
- [What Makes a Blockchain Truly Fast: A Technical Deep Dive](https://promiseresearch.web3ium.space/what-makes-a-blockchain-truly-fast-a-technical-deep-dive): This paper presents a comprehensive technical analysis of the fundamental factors that enable high-performance blockchain systems. Through rigorous examination of consensus mechanisms, network architectures, and cryptographic optimizations, we identify key performance determinants that distinguish fast blockchains from traditional implementations. Our analysis reveals that modern high-performance blockchains achieve throughput improvements of 100-1000x over Bitcoin through innovations in consensus algorithms (PBFT variants achieving 10,000+ TPS), network topology optimization (sharding enabling linear scalability), and cryptographic efficiency (BLS signatures reducing verification overhead by 90%). We present empirical evidence from production implementations and controlled experiments, demonstrating that the combination of optimized consensus, parallel processing, and efficient gossip protocols can achieve sub-second finality with throughput exceeding 1,000,000 TPS. Our findings have significant implications for blockchain applications in AI systems, particularly for decentralized data provenance, secure model verification, and scalable compute coordination.

Instead of subscribing to services or creating accounts, you pay small amounts (micropayments) instantly to access what you need — like paying for a single API call, reading one article, or getting one piece of data.

- [Privacy as Infrastructure: Trustless AI Systems](https://promiseresearch.web3ium.space/privacy-as-infrastructure-trustless-ai-systems): Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown quickly and created a privacy gap. We need to balance using these tools with keeping control of our data. This report looks at new technologies that address this issue. We call this \"Privacy as Infrastructure.\" This means we use software and hardware to protect data automatically.
- [The Agent Network Protocol (ANP): A Decentralized Communication Substrate for Autonomous AI Agents](https://promiseresearch.web3ium.space/the-agent-network-protocol-anp-a-decentralized-communication-substrate-for-autonomous-ai-agents): The transition of Large Language Models (LLMs) from static reasoning engines to autonomous agents necessitates a robust, machine-native communication infrastructure. Current agentic interactions are hampered by \"digital silos\" and human-centric interfaces, leading to significant information entropy and collaboration overhead. This paper introduces the open source Agent Network Protocol (ANP), a three-layer modular blueprint designed to facilitate seamless peer-to-peer (P2P) interaction, decentralized identity (DID) management, and automated capability discovery. By establishing a universal \"handshake\" mechanism and machine-readable description standards, ANP transforms the internet into an AI-native ecosystem, enabling recursive intelligence and a trustless machine-to-machine economy.
