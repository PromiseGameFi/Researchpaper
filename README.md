## &#x20;Career Journey

My career started off as a gameplay engineer, and I have worked at top studios like **Naughty Dog** and also led the development team at **EOTH Game Studio**.

As I advanced in my career, protocol engineering became important to develop better infrastructure for AI and blockchain use cases in games and virtual experiences.

## &#x20;Research & Education

I am a researcher/educator and have taken on research and developer experience engineering roles throughout my career.
